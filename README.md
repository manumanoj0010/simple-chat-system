**Step 1** : Install the xampp software in your pc

**Step 6** : Open your xampp software and press MySql admin now you will be opened with the sql admin panel

**Step 7** : Create a newdatabase name same as provided in the ***server.php***  file and ***db.php* ** file. In the file server.php the database name is "**chat**".  So create a same database in your localhost/phpmyadmin.

**Step 8: ** Now you can either import the **sql file** in the database or you can manually create tables and fill the table. I have included a sql file so you can directly import it.
